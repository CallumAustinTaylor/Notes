# Notes
Notes is a simple rust cli notes program (surely a more creative name is on the way lol).

## Purpose
This is me learning coding for the first time. Someone said Rust was cool to learn, so this is me following the docs and learning along the way!

## How to
This is hard-coded to make notes in `~/Documents/Todo`. If you want this to work, you should make that directory or otherwise edit `arguments.rs` and change the directory path. 
To get this to run, you will need to build it with Cargo and run `Cargo build -r` while in the notes directory.
